  <h1> My Data Story </h1>
  <p> We're living in a society that uses digital technology and media to collect, organize, and analyze data about a multitude of ourselves. For my data story, I started with a projecct that challeneged me to learn how to produce digital media from my everyday life. I started off by collecting data and then went on to make an explained video that took my everyday data and connected it to something larger. This data story is meant to take something simple and have my audience think about it with a different perspective! </p>

      <h1> Data Collection Heading </h1>
        <p> The main point of this data collection was to explore and gain insight into my writing practices and how digital media and data permeate it. By doing this, I've learned to understand how digital media performs and communicates much more than what we may have originally thought. </p>

      <h1> Data Visualization Heading </h1>
      <p> After I collected my data, I analyzed it and developed categories and codes to visualize. I analyzed and explored my data to learn basic visualization conventions and through this, I made decisions about how I wanted to visualize my categories and their relationships. </p> </div>

      <h1> Explained Video Heading </h1>
      <p> My video explores and explains issues linked to my digital media/technological practice and how corporations and companies commodify such practices. I researched and created a short explanatory video about what can you learn about the data connected to your digital media practice. I pursued boarder questions such as: How do your own digital practices hook into business practices? And, what are your own opinions based on what you learned? </p>

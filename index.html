         <h1> My Data Story 
         </h1>
         	<p> We're living in a society that uses digital technology and media to collect,
         	organize, and analyze data about a multitude of ourselves. For my data story, I
         	started with a projecct that challeneged me to learn how to produce digital media
         	from my everyday life. I started off by collecting data, making a visual from that
         	data and then and then went on to make an explained video that took my everyday data 
         	and connected it to something larger. This data story is meant to take something 
         	simple and have my audience think about it with a different perspective!

               <h1> Data Collection 
               </h1>
               <p> The main point of this data collection was to explore and gain insight
               into my writing practices and how digital media and data permeate it. I chose
               to collect my data on memes for one week. There were a lot of categories that
               went into this collection, such as the date/time, the app I was using, 
               what I was using, where I was, etc. By doing this, I've learned to understand 
               how digital media performs and communicates much more than what we may have 
               originally thought. I personally learned that I look at way too many memes!

               <h1> Data Visualization 
               </h1>
               <p> After I collected my data, I analyzed it and developed categories and
               codes to visualize. I analyzed and explored my data to learn basic visualization
               conventions and through this, I made decisions about how I wanted to visualize
               my categories and their relationships and came up with a temporal chart. My 
               chart is laid out the way it is so I could see the different times of day in 
               each day going down the rows. My marks and attributes amplify these patterns 
               because the same concept is seen throughout each day. It’s very easy to 
               understand because once you learn how to read one box, it is easy to read the rest. 
               I’ve given every attribute their own shape and the legend is what actually 
               helps you read it. The colors are a very big part of reading this chart and 
               everything is signified through the colors labeled in the legends! For example,
               After learning how to read this chart, my audience would see what social media 
               apps I used the most. This may get them to think about why someone would 
               use a certain app so much, which leads to the rules that they have to follow 
               in order to use it - the larger idea it connects to my Explained Video below!

               </h1>
            	<p> My video explores and explains issues linked to my data visual. I researched
            	and created a short explanatory video about what can you learn about the data
            	connected to your digital media practice. From my data visual, I decided to
            	research End User Rights as it applied to my mostly. I've been using these apps
            	so I wanted to know the rules and things I agreed to or gave up when I agreed
            	to the social media's terms. I answered questions like: How do your own digital 
            	practices hook into business practices? And, what are your own opinions based 
            	on what you learned?

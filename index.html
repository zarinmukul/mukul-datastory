         <h1> My Data Story 
         </h1>
         	<p> We're living in a society that uses digital technology and media to collect,
         	organize, and analyze data about a multitude of ourselves. For my data story, I
         	started with a projecct that challeneged me to learn how to produce digital media
         	from my everyday life. I started off by collecting data, making a visual from that
         	data and then and then went on to make an explained video that took my everyday data 
         	and connected it to something larger. This data story is meant to take something 
         	simple and have my audience think about it with a different perspective!

               <h1> Data Collection 
               </h1>
               <p> The main point of this data collection was to explore and gain insight
               into my writing practices and how digital media and data permeate it. By doing
               this, I've learned to understand how digital media performs and communicates
               much more than what we may have originally thought.

               <h1> Data Visualization 
               </h1>
               <p> After I collected my data, I analyzed it and developed categories and
               codes to visualize. I analyzed and explored my data to learn basic visualization
               conventions and through this, I made decisions about how I wanted to visualize
               my categories and their relationships and came up with a temporal chart.

            	<p> My video explores and explains issues linked to my data visual. I researched
            	and created a short explanatory video about what can you learn about the data
            	connected to your digital media practice. I answered questions like:
            	How do your own digital practices hook into business practices? (End User Rights)
            	And, what are your own opinions based on what you learned?
